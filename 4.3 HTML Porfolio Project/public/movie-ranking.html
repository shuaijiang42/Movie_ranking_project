<h1>The Best Movies According to Shuai</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<br>
<h3>Gone with the wind</h3>
<p>I love the story and the vintage feeling of it.</p>
<h3>Grand Budapest Hotel </h3>
<p>The color, the humor, the camera. A master piece.</p>
<h3> Airplane!</h3>
<p>Too funny to not watch it again and again and again.</p>
