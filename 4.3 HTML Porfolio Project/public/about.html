<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in 1994, I come from a beautiful Chinese city called Suzhou. 
  Travelling and settling abroad independently has moulded me into an active and optimistic person, 
  who is passionate about learning and courageous in the face of challenges. 
  I have many hobbies such as exploring foreign cultures, singing, playing musical instruments, cooking, photography, sports, nature etc. </p>
